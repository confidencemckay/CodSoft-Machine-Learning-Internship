🎬 Movie Genre Prediction (NLP)

Developed a text classification model to predict movie genres from plot descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. Implemented data preprocessing, model validation, and multi-class evaluation, achieving reliable genre predictions and exporting results for unseen data.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP

💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

Built a machine learning system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Performed data cleaning, feature encoding, normalization, and exploratory analysis using correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to compare model performance.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

🔁 Customer Churn Prediction

Designed an end-to-end churn prediction pipeline to identify customers at risk of leaving a service. Conducted exploratory data analysis, addressed class imbalance through resampling, and compared multiple classifiers including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to optimize predictive accuracy.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
